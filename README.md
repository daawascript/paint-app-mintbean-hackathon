# Paint!

Paint! is an app to unleash your creativity through your computer screen. [Check it out!](https://paint-app.theoleveque.com).

## Tech Stack

I picked my favorite tech stack for this project with TypeScript, React, Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I also used Konva as a way to simplify Canvas interaction.

- TypeScript helps in reducing bugs and provides a next-level developer experience with intellisense
- React is awesome at creating interactive UI and reusable components
- Next.js is there for its SSG capabilities as well as painless routing
- Tailwind is just the best CSS framework out there to get a project up and running with minimum effort
